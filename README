This ansible playbook is designed for repo based Quobyte installations on nodes with Internet access. The playbook will install and configure prerequisites beforeinstalling and configuring a Quobyte cluster that can immediately be used to write data to (batteries included).


The Quobyte client will be installed on the storage nodes, additional clients can be installed using the same playbook by populating the client nodes in the [clients] section of the inventory file.

Terminology:

Bootstrap
- Has CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 18 up and running
- Requires an Ansible management node or the first node in the Quobyte cluster to have ansible installed
- Has root access to all nodes and clients that should be part of the cluster by name
- Has passwordless key access to all cluster and client nodes
- The host key for all cluster and client nodes has been accepted (by connecting to each node once)

Cluster Node
- Has CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 18 up and running
- A server that fulfills the minimal requirements to become a quobyte node
- Has a root account configured used to allow management via ansible

Client Node
- Has CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 18 up and running (Quobyte also support clients for Windows and MAc but support for these are not included in this playbook)
- A server that fulfills the minimal requirements to become a quobyte client
- Has a root account configured used to allow management via ansible

Preparation:

1) Edit the inventory file
 a) In section [cluster] put all Cluster Nodes by name (one per line)
 b) In section [bootstrap] put one Cluster Node by name
 c) In section [nodes] put all Cluster Nodes except the one you selected to be the bootstrap node 
 d) In section [diskformat] put in all Cluster Nodes if you want the playbook to automaticly create a default volume (batteries included) (requires mddisksize)
 d) In section [clients] put all Client Nodes by name (one per line) (Cluster nodes already have the client installed)

2) Edit vars/quobyte.yaml
   Set the variables to a meaningful value for your environment
     repository: The Quobyte repo id that you have received after signing up on www.quobyte.com
     registry: The DNS A record for service discovery (example: registry.quobyte.local)
     mddisksize: The size of the flash device used for metadata on each node 64 (output size from lsblk) (only required when using [diskformat])
     mountpoint: Mountpoint name for the Quobyte client (example: /quobyte)

3) Start the installation
   Within the quobyte-rpm-ansible directory run the following command on the Ansible management node or the Bootstrap node of the Quobyte cluster
   ansible-playbook -b -i inventory quobyte.yaml
